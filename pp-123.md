## About this tutorial

This tutorial walks you through Python packaging basics.

## Module

### There are actually three different ways to define a module in Python

1. A module can be written in Python itself.
2. A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.
3. A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.

A moduleâ€™s contents are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the import statement.

## Modules

Files containing Python code are refered to as modules. Modules can contain a Python script 
to be ran or functions and/of classes to be imported.

THe module used to run a script is referd to as the `main module`.


Example module:

We write the following code to a file named fibo.py

``` python
# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()
```

it can be imported into another like so:

``` python
import fibo
```

## Executing modules

We run Python modules like this:

```bash
python fibo.py <arguments>
```

The code in the module will be executed just as it would if you imported it. But with a standard available argument ``__name__`` set to be equal ``"__main__"``.

*Making the following run only when executed as a main module.*

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
```

Now the file works as a importable script and as a executable module. Success!

## Packages

A Python package is most often represented as a regular directory containing a ``__init__.py``file. As of Python 3.4 the ``__init__.py``is not necessary to use the directory as a package but it is the common practice.

#### Note
Packages are modules! But they are special modules. They are modules that can contain other modules.

**Package modules have a path attribute**


## Executing Packages


## Relative vs absolute imports

## Python package layout

Typical Python package layout
```
project_name/
    README.(rst/md)
    docs/
    package_name/
        __init__.py
        source.py
        sub_package_1/
            __init__.py
    tests/
        test_code.py

```
