# Python package in 1-2-3

## About this tutorial

This tutorial walks you through Python packaging basics.

## Modules

Files containing Python code are refered to as modules. Modules can contain a Python script 
to be ran or functions and/of classes to be imported.

THe module used to run a script is referd to as the `main module`.

Example module:

We write the following code to a file named fibo.py

``` python
# Fibonacci numbers module

def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a < n:
        print(a, end=' ')
        a, b = b, a+b
    print()
```

it can be imported into another like so:

``` python
import fibo
```

## Executing modules

We run Python modules like this:

```bash
python fibo.py <arguments>
```

The code in the module will be executed just as it would if you imported it. But with a standard available argument ``__name__`` set to be equal ``"__main__"``.

*Making the following run only when executed as a main module.*

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
```

Now the file works as a importable script and as a executable module. Success!

## Packages

## Executing Packages


## Relative vs absolute imports

## Python package layout

Typical Python package layout
```
project_name/
    README.(rst/md)
    docs/
    package_name/
        __init__.py
        source.py
        sub_package_1/
            __init__.py
    tests/
        test_code.py

```
